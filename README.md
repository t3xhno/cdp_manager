# React + TypeScript + Vite

## Initialization instructions

The basics - install dependencies and then run the `dev` script:

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

Modified behavior - the `run` script contains an invocation to the `typechain` tool, which generates our ABI types, and outputs them in the `src/types/abiTypes` directory.

The ABI type generation can also be manually invoked by running:

```bash
npm run generate-typechain
```
